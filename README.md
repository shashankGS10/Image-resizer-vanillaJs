# Image-resizer-vanillaJs
This is an App resizes the images having height and width:1024px each. The Reason behind creating this in Vanilla Js is that, it will be easy to show the DOM manipulation happening under the hood , using libraries might have made my codes look fancier but they hold their own ideology and zest. In this case, using libraries would have handled things differently and more efficiency but I believe if you have grip on core idea than surely we can work on libraries and framework with more understanding. Clone it, play with it, tweak it.  ðŸ˜ƒ  HAPPY CODINGðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
